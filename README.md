This website tracks the most recent 50 pages of Cities Skylines Steam Workshop uploads and filters out the following submissions: Map, Save Game, District Style, Scenario, Intersection

Submissions without any preview image other than the default thumbnail are also filtered out

Just a small hobby project. I don't know how long this site will live
