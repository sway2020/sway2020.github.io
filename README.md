This website tracks the most recent 50 pages of Cities Skylines Steam Workshop uploads and filters out most of the following submissions: Map, Save Game, District Style, Scenario, Intersection

Most submissions without any preview image are also filtered out, except for Mods

Just a small hobby project. I don't know how long this site will live
