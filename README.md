# sway2020.github.io

A simple website that tracks the most recent 50 pages of Cities Skylines Steam Workshop uploads and filters out the following submissions: Map, Save Game, District Style, Map Theme, Scenario, Intersection

Submissions without any preview image are also filtered out

Just a small hobby project. I don't know how long this site will live
